I need a delete user endpoint

when getting friends I need to return: alias, avatar, online/offline, rating

create these pages:
    /email-verification-success - Shows success message
    /email-verification-failed - Shows error and "resend verification" option
    /email-verification-error - Shows generic error message
and redirect to them

use websockets
